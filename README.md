# Student-form-using-JPDB-API
This is the first form which I have created using JPDB API in NetBeans.

The project which I have worked on is the creation of a Student form using HTML, JavaScript and JPDB API. The code is compiled and run in the NetBeans IDE.
The benefits of JsonPowerDB which I liked so much was, its simple language to use, easy to maintain, best performance, serverless support.
